Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and Power by
    Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes for a main effect model where the
    covariate is biallelic SNP. It supports simulation-based power
    calculation for stand-alone case-control studies and for case-control
    analyses nested in cohort studies, that take account of realistic
    assessment error.
