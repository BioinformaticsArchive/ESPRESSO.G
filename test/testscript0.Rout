> # this script test 18 scenarios, for a binary outcome, to compare the results across differents setting 
> # and ensure there is no 'weird' results due to some bug not spotted by R checks.
> #
> # the 18 scenarios are divided into 6 classes of checks as follow (starting from scenario 1 to 18):
> # 1st class: 3 minor allele frequencies; 0.15, 0.25 and 0.4
> # 2nd class: 3 OR related to the 'at risk' genetic exposure; 1.2, 2 and 3.5
> # 3rd class: 3 Baseline ORs (heterogeneity in baseline risk of disease); 8, 12 and 16
> # 4th class: 3 sensitivity values for the outcome; 0.65, 8, 1
> # 5th class: 3 specificity values for the outcome; 0.65, 8, 1
> # 6th class: 3 start number of cases/controls ; 1000/4000, 2000/8000 and 2000/4000
> #
> # apart from these parameters all the other parameters are set to the same values across all 18 scenarios
> 
> # load the library required for an analysis with a main effect environmental exposure
